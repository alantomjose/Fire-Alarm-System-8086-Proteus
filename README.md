# Fire-Alarm-System-8086-Proteus
Fire Alarm System made with 8086 microprocessor in Proteus

## Description of System
This system checks for abnormal smoke content in a room and under such conditions throws
open all exit doors and windows and opens a valve that releases the gas to put-out the fire.
An Alarm is also sounded; this alarm is sounded until the smoke level in the room drops to an
acceptable level. The room has two doors and four windows. The smoke detection system is 
made up of three smoke sensors placed on the ceiling of the room. When at least two of three
detectors get turned on, the alarm system is activated. If only one of them is activated a 
different alarm sound is produced indicating probable malfunction of alarm. The system can
be activated or deactivated using a single switch.
